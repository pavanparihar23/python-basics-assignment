        "Ques-6 Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans-6 The distinction between mutable lists and immutable tuples in Python is largely due to the design choices that align with their intended uses, efficiency considerations, and the principles of Python’s data model.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Use Case and Flexibility\n",
        ".Lists are intended to be dynamic, flexible collections of items that can grow or shrink over time. They are typically used when you need to frequently modify the collection (adding, removing, or changing elements). For example, a list might be used to store a collection of items where the contents can change throughout the program.\n",
        "\n",
        ".Tuples, on the other hand, are intended to represent fixed collections of items, where immutability provides a guarantee that the elements cannot be changed once defined. Tuples are often used to represent data that should remain constant, such as coordinates, records, or configurations that should not be modified.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Memory Efficiency and Performance\n",
        ".Mutability in Lists: The ability to modify the contents of a list allows Python to efficiently handle changes in the list size. Lists are implemented with a dynamic array under the hood, meaning Python can resize the array when elements are added or removed. This dynamic resizing allows for flexible and efficient management of memory.\n",
        "\n",
        ".Immutability in Tuples: Tuples, being immutable, are implemented in a way that allows for more efficient memory usage. Since their size and contents are fixed once they are created, the underlying implementation can make use of optimizations like memory sharing. Immutable objects can be shared between parts of a program safely without worrying about unexpected modifications, reducing overhead and increasing performance in certain situations.\n",
        "\n",
        "The key benefit of immutable objects (like tuples) is that they can be hashable and used as keys in dictionaries or elements in sets. Lists, being mutable, are not hashable and cannot be used in these contexts.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Data Integrity and Safety\n",
        ".Tuples as Immutable Containers: Immutability is particularly useful in situations where data integrity is important, such as when passing data between different parts of a program. If you want to ensure that a collection of values cannot be altered during the program's execution (e.g., when passing function arguments or returning multiple values from a function), a tuple provides a safe, unchangeable structure.\n",
        "\n",
        ".Lists as Mutable Containers: In contrast, lists are designed for use cases where modification is expected. For example, lists are commonly used for tasks like iterating through data and applying modifications to the collection. Lists are generally more flexible, but the downside is that they are prone to accidental changes, which can be risky in some contexts. This is why Python uses the convention of using immutable tuples when data should not change, and mutable lists when data is expected to change.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Hashability and Dictionary Keys\n",
        ".Tuples are hashable, meaning they can be used as keys in a dictionary or as elements in a set. This is possible because once a tuple is created, its contents are guaranteed not to change, ensuring a consistent hash value.\n",
        ".Lists are not hashable, because allowing them to change would create inconsistency when they are used as dictionary keys or set elements. Since lists can change in size or content, Python cannot ensure their hash value remains stable over time.\n",
        "5. Python's Design Philosophy\n",
        "Python follows the principle of \"consenting adults\", meaning it provides flexibility and power to the programmer while also giving them the responsibility to avoid mistakes. Lists being mutable reflect Python’s emphasis on providing tools for practical and flexible programming. Tuples, on the other hand, represent a more functional-style of programming, where data is treated as immutable and treated more like a value than a reference that can change over time.\n",
        "6. Performance and Internal Representation\n",
        ".Lists require extra overhead to support their mutability (e.g., the ability to grow, shrink, and rearrange items). They are designed to be fast for certain use cases, especially when you need frequent updates, but they carry extra overhead to manage these changes.\n",
        ".Tuples are typically smaller in memory because they don't need the extra functionality that supports mutability. They can be packed into a smaller memory footprint, making them more lightweight when used in contexts where immutability is an advantage.\n",
        "Summary of Key Points:\n",
        ".Lists are mutable because they are designed for use cases where you need to frequently change the contents (adding, removing, or modifying elements).\n",
        ".Tuples are immutable to represent fixed collections of values, ensuring data integrity and supporting performance optimizations, including hashability (for use as dictionary keys or set elements).\n",
        ".Immutability in tuples allows Python to make memory optimizations, as immutable objects are more predictable and safe to share across different parts of a program.\n",
